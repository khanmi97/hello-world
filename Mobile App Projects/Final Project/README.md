This app is the final project of the course. The app combines many of the concepts learned in the course together. For this final project, I developed and implemented an app called TheReviewer which allows users to add movie, TV show, and game reviews. The title is shown in a tableview. All of the reviews are stored in the device using core data. Users can add as many review to the app as desired. In a review, users can add the genre, image to represnt the media, ratings out of 10, and a text review. Using the app, users can find a nearby theaters using the map and location functionality that is present in the app. The reviews can be shared on Facebook with friends.
